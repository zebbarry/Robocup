12V DC Electromagnet
5V - 0.1A
9V - 0.2A
13V - 0.3A
Works well for all but must touch weight to attach.





Testing
- IR sensors range and angles
- IR sensor interferance
- Electromagnet weight at each voltage; attach distatnce ; weight on its side, they might get knocked over
- Torque of motors for tilting electromagnet with weight attached
- Capacitance sensor
- Ultrasonic sensor range and accuracy
- Camera vision (navigate to most reflective object)?

I = IR


Motor tilts weight attached to electromagnet, through a set of paddles(?), where it slides or rolls out tof the way

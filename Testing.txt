12V DC Electromagnet
5V - 0.1A
9V - 0.2A
13V - 0.3A
Works well for all but must touch weight to attach.


5/1024 - qunatisation error


Testing
- IR sensors range and angles
- IR sensor interferance
- Electromagnet weight at each voltage; attach distatnce ; weight on its side, they might get knocked over
- Torque of motors for tilting electromagnet with weight attached
- Capacitance sensor
- Ultrasonic sensor range and accuracy
- Camera vision (navigate to most reflective object)?

O = weight
C = capacitance sensor
I = IR


Motor tilts weight attached to electromagnet, through a set of paddles(?), where it slides or rolls out tof the way


IR testing
- Bolted to sheet lying on ground using 2mm perspex perpendicular to lense.
- Narraw field of vision, cannot detect objects marginally below it and to the sides.
- Cant differentiate materials.
- Pipe obstacle returned slightly lower voltage than a wall and the difference increases slightly as you move further away


Short Range Sensor
Dead zone at 66mm from lense with analog value of 640.
Maximum distance at 500mm with analog value of 45-70, resting value.

Stated values from datasheet: 
Dead zone - 	40mm
Max - 		300mm

Medium Range Sensor
Dead zone at 150mm from lense with analog value of 530.
Maximum distance at 1150mm with analog value of 85-100, resting value.

Long Range Sensor
Dead zone at 620mm from lense with analog value of 620.
Maximum distance at 3000mm with analog value of 200-240, resting value.


Large ultrasound sensor testing
 - Wide angle
 - Minimal noise

Dead zone at 340mm from base with value of 70.
Maximum distance at 5000mm but unreliable.
